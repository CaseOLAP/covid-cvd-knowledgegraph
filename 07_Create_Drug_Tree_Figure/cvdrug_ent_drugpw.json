Human insulin is produced by recombinant DNA technology and is identical to endogenously produced insulin. Typically prescribed for the management of diabetes mellitus, insulin is a peptide hormone produced by beta cells of the pancreas that promotes glucose metabolism. Insulin is released from the pancreas following a meal to promote the uptake of glucose from the blood into internal organs and tissues such as the liver, fat cells, and skeletal muscle. Absorption of glucose into cells allows for its transformation into glycogen or fat for storage. Insulin also inhibits hepatic glucose production, enhances protein synthesis, and inhibits lipolysis and proteolysis among many other functions.\r\n\r\nInsulin is an important treatment in the management of Type 1 Diabetes (T1D) which is caused by an autoimmune reaction that destroys the beta cells of the pancreas, resulting in the body not being able to produce or synthesize the insulin needed to manage circulating blood sugar levels. As a result, people with T1D rely primarily on exogenous forms of insulin to lower glucose levels in the blood. Insulin is also used in the treatment of Type 2 Diabetes (T2D), another form of diabetes mellitus that is a slowly progressing metabolic disorder caused by a combination of genetic and lifestyle factors that promote chronically elevated blood sugar levels. Without treatment or improvement in non-pharmacological measures such as diet and exercise to lower blood glucose, high blood sugar eventually causes cellular resistance to endogenous insulin, and in the long term, damage to pancreatic islet cells. Insulin is typically prescribed later in the course of T2D, after trying several oral medications such as [DB00331], [DB01120], or [DB01261] have been tried, when sufficient damage has been caused to pancreatic cells that the body is no longer able to produce insulin on its own. \r\n\r\nMarketed as the brand name product Humulin R or Novolin R, human insulin begins to exert its effects within 30 minutes of subcutaneous administration, while peak levels occur 3-4 hours after administration. Due to its quick onset of action, human insulin is considered \"bolus insulin\" as it provides high levels of insulin in a short period of time to mimic the release of endogenous insulin from the pancreas after meals. Bolus insulin is often combined with once daily, long-acting \"basal insulin\" such as [DB01307], [DB09564], and [DB00047] to provide low concentrations of background insulin that can keep blood sugar stable between meals or overnight. Use of basal and bolus insulin together is intended to mimic the pancreas' production of endogenous insulin, with a goal of avoiding any periods of hypoglycemia.\r\n\r\nHuman insulin is also available in an inhalable form, intended to be used as a bolus meal-time insulin. Exubera was the first inhaled insulin available on the market and was developed by Inhale Therapeutics (later named Nektar Therapeutics). Unfortunately, limited uptake by physicians and patients, poor sales, bulky packaging, and concerns over the possible impact on lung cancer development resulted in Exubera products being withdrawn from the US markets [A176005]. Exubera was followed by Afrezza, a monomeric inhaled insulin developed by Mannkind Corporation, which received FDA approval in 2016. While still available in the US, Afrezza has had similar concerns associated with its use, and had an FDA \"black box\" warning added to it to warn about use in patients with chronic lung disease. Afrezza does not currently have Health Canada or European Medicines Agency approval for marketing in Canada or the EU. \r\n\r\nHuman Insulin is a 51 residue peptide hormone produced by recombinant DNA technology by inserting the human insulin gene into Escherichia coli bacteria or Saccharomyces cerevisiae. The structure is identical to native human insulin, with two amino acid chains covalently linked by disulfide bonds. \r\n\r\nHuman insulin is also available in an intermediate-acting form as NPH (Neutral Protamine Hagedorn) as the marketed products Novolin N and Humulin N. NPH insulin is provided as a crystalline suspension of insulin with protamine and zinc, resulting in an onset of action in 1 to 3 hours, duration of action up to 24 hours, and peak action from 6 to 8 hours. Due to the added crystals, NPH insulin is typically cloudy when compared to other forms of insulin and has a neutral pH.\r\n\r\nWithout an adequate supply of insulin to promote absorption of glucose from the bloodstream, blood sugar levels can climb to dangerously high levels and can result in symptoms such as fatigue, headache, blurred vision, and increased thirst. If left untreated, the body starts to break down fat, instead of glucose, for energy which results in a build-up of ketone acids in the blood and a syndrome called ketoacidosis, which is a life-threatening medical emergency.

ARBs selectively bind to angiotensin receptor 1 (AT1) and prevent the protein angiotensin II from binding and exerting its hypertensive effects, which include vasoconstriction, stimulation and synthesis of aldosterone and ADH, cardiac stimulation, and renal reabsorption of sodium, among others. Overall, valsartan's physiologic effects lead to reduced blood pressure, lower aldosterone levels, reduced cardiac activity, and increased excretion of sodium. \r\n\r\nValsartan also affects the renin-angiotensin aldosterone system (RAAS), which plays an important role in hemostasis and regulation of kidney, vascular, and cardiac functions. Pharmacological blockade of RAAS via  AT1 receptor blockade inhibits negative regulatory feedback within RAAS, which is a contributing factor to the pathogenesis and progression of cardiovascular disease, heart failure, and renal disease. In particular, heart failure is associated with chronic activation of RAAS, leading to inappropriate fluid retention, vasoconstriction, and ultimately a further decline in left ventricular function. ARBs have been shown to have a protective effect on the heart by improving cardiac function, reducing afterload, increasing cardiac output and preventing ventricular hypertrophy and remodelling.[A174154] \r\n\r\nBy comparison, the angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor (ACEI) class of medications (which includes drugs such as [ramipril], [lisinopril], and [perindopril]) inhibit the conversion of angiotensin I to angiotensin II through inhibition of the ACE enzyme. However, this does not prevent the formation of all angiotensin II within the body. The angiotensin II receptor blocker (ARB) family of drugs unique in that it blocks all angiotensin II activity, regardless of where or how it was synthesized. \r\n\r\nValsartan is commonly used for the management of hypertension, heart failure, and Type 2 Diabetes-associated nephropathy, particularly in patients who are unable to tolerate ACE inhibitors.

The clear evidence of the benefit of statin use coupled with very minimal side effects or long term effects has resulted in this class becoming one of the most widely prescribed medications in North America.[A181087, A181406]\r\n\r\nLovastatin and other drugs from the statin class of medications including [atorvastatin], [pravastatin], [rosuvastatin], [fluvastatin], and [simvastatin] are considered first-line options for the treatment of dyslipidemia.[A181087, A181406] Increasing use of the statin class of drugs is largely due to the fact that cardiovascular disease (CVD), which includes heart attack, atherosclerosis, angina, peripheral artery disease, and stroke, has become a leading cause of death in high-income countries and a major cause of morbidity around the world.[A181084] Elevated cholesterol levels, and in particular, elevated low-density lipoprotein (LDL) levels, are an important risk factor for the development of CVD.[A181087,A181553] Use of statins to target and reduce LDL levels has been shown in a number of landmark studies to significantly reduce the risk of development of CVD and all-cause mortality.[A181090,A181093,A181096,A181427,A181475,A181538] Statins are considered a cost-effective treatment option for CVD due to their evidence of reducing all-cause mortality including fatal and non-fatal CVD as well as the need for surgical revascularization or angioplasty following a heart attack.[A181087, A181406] Evidence has shown that even for low-risk individuals (with <10% risk of a major vascular event occurring within 5 years) statins cause a 20%-22% relative reduction in major cardiovascular events (heart attack, stroke, coronary revascularization, and coronary death) for every 1 mmol/L reduction in LDL without any significant side effects or risks.[A181397, A181403]\r\n\r\nWhile all statin medications are considered equally effective from a clinical standpoint, [rosuvastatin] is considered the most potent; doses of 10 to 40mg [rosuvastatin] per day were found in clinical studies to result in a 45.8% to 54.6% decrease in LDL cholesterol levels, while lovastatin has been found to have an average decrease in LDL-C of 25-40%.[A174580,A181409,A181535,A181538,A1793] Potency is thought to correlate to tissue permeability as the more lipophilic statins such as lovastatin are thought to enter endothelial cells by passive diffusion, as opposed to hydrophilic statins such as [pravastatin] and [rosuvastatin] which are taken up into hepatocytes through OATP1B1 (organic anion transporter protein 1B1)-mediated transport.[A181424,A181460] Despite these differences in potency, several trials have demonstrated only minimal differences in terms of clinical outcomes between statins.[A181438, A181427]", "categories": ["Agents Causing Muscle Toxicity", "Anticholesteremic Agents", "BSEP/ABCB11 Substrates", "Cytochrome P-450 CYP2C19 Substrates", "Cytochrome P-450 CYP2C8 Inhibitors", "Cytochrome P-450 CYP2C8 Inhibitors (moderate)", "Cytochrome P-450 CYP2C8 Substrates", "Cytochrome P-450 CYP2C9 Inhibitors", "Cytochrome P-450 CYP2C9 Inhibitors (strength unknown)", "Cytochrome P-450 CYP2D6 Inhibitors", "Cytochrome P-450 CYP2D6 Inhibitors (weak)", "Cytochrome P-450 CYP3A Inhibitors", "Cytochrome P-450 CYP3A Substrates", "Cytochrome P-450 CYP3A4 Inhibitors", "Cytochrome P-450 CYP3A4 Inhibitors (moderate)", "Cytochrome P-450 CYP3A4 Substrates", "Cytochrome P-450 CYP3A5 Substrates", "Cytochrome P-450 CYP3A7 Substrates", "Cytochrome P-450 Enzyme Inhibitors", "Cytochrome P-450 Substrates", "Drugs causing inadvertant photosensitivity", "Enzyme Inhibitors", "Hydroxymethylglutaryl-CoA Reductase Inhibitors", "Hypolipidemic Agents", "Hypolipidemic Agents Indicated for Hyperlipidemia", "Lipid Modifying Agents", "Lipid Regulating Agents", "OATP1B1/SLCO1B1 Inhibitors", "OATP1B1/SLCO1B1 Substrates", "P-glycoprotein inhibitors", "Photosensitizing Agents", "UGT1A1 Substrates", "UGT1A3 substrates", "UGT2B7 substrates"], "ATC code": ["C10AA02", "C10BA01"], "indication": "Lovastatin is indicated to reduce the risk of myocardial infarction, unstable angina, and the need for coronary revascularization procedures in individuals without symptomatic cardiovascular disease, average to moderately elevated total-C and LDL-C, and below average HDL-C.

Overall, olmesartan's physiologic effects lead to reduced blood pressure, lower aldosterone levels, reduced cardiac activity, and increased excretion of sodium. \r\n\r\nOlmesartan also affects the renin-angiotensin aldosterone system (RAAS), which plays an important role in hemostasis and regulation of kidney, vascular, and cardiac functions. Pharmacological blockade of RAAS via  AT1 receptor blockade inhibits negative regulatory feedback within RAAS, which is a contributing factor to the pathogenesis and progression of cardiovascular disease, heart failure, and renal disease. In particular, heart failure is associated with chronic activation of RAAS, leading to inappropriate fluid retention, vasoconstriction, and ultimately a further decline in left ventricular function. ARBs have been shown to have a protective effect on the heart by improving cardiac function, reducing afterload, increasing cardiac output and preventing ventricular hypertrophy and remodelling.[A174154] \r\n\r\nBy comparison, the angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor (ACEi) class of medications (which includes drugs such as [ramipril], [lisinopril], and [perindopril]) inhibit the conversion of angiotensin I to angiotensin II through inhibition of the ACE enzyme. However, this does not prevent the formation of all angiotensin II within the body. The angiotensin II receptor blocker (ARB) family of drugs unique in that it blocks all angiotensin II activity, regardless of where or how it was synthesized. \r\n\r\nOlmesartan is commonly used for the management of hypertension and Type 2 Diabetes-associated nephropathy, particularly in patients who are unable to tolerate ACE inhibitors.

It ultimately elicits its numbing activity by blocking sodium channels so that the neurons of local tissues that have the medication applied on are transiently incapable of signaling the brain regarding sensations [F4349, L5930, L5948]. In doing so, however, it can block or decrease muscle contractile, resulting in effects like vasodilation, hypotension, and irregular heart rate, among others [F4349, L5930, L5948]. As a result, lidocaine is also considered a class Ib anti-arrhythmic agent [L5930, L5948, F4468]. Nevertheless, lidocaine's local anesthetic action sees its use in many medical situations or circumstances that may benefit from its action, including the treatment of premature ejaculation [A177625].\r\n\r\nRegardless, lidocaine is currently available as a relatively non-expensive generic medication that is written for in millions of prescriptions internationally on a yearly basis.

The exact mechanism of chlorthalidone's anti-hypertensive effect is under debate, however, it is thought that increased diuresis results in decreased plasma and extracellular fluid volume, decreased cardiac output and therefore overall reduction in blood pressure.[A176324]\r\n\r\nChlorthalidone is considered first-line therapy for management of uncomplicated hypertension as there is strong evidence from meta-analyses that thiazide diuretics such as chlorthalidone reduce the risk of stroke, myocardial infarction, heart failure, and cardiovascular all-cause mortality in patients with hypertension.[A173863] In particular, the ALLHAT trial confirmed the role of thiazide diuretics as first-line therapy and demonstrated that chlorthalidone had a statistically significant lower incidence of stroke and heart failure when compared to [DB00722], [DB00381], or [DB00590].[A173884, A173887] Further studies have indicated that low-dose thiazides are as good as, and in some secondary endpoints, better than \u03b2-blockers, ACE inhibitors, Calcium Channel Blockers or ARBs.\r\n\r\nChlorthalidone has been shown to have a number of pleiotropic effects that differentiate it from other diuretics such as [DB00999]. In addition to its antihypertensive effects, chlorthalidone has also been shown to decrease platelet aggregation and vascular permeability, as well as promote angiogenesis in vitro, which is thought to be partly the result of reductions in carbonic anhydrase\u2013dependent pathways. These pathways may play a role in chlorthalidone's cardiovascular risk reduction effects.[A176330]", "categories": ["Acids, Carbocyclic", "Amides", "Antihypertensive Agents", "Antihypertensive Agents Indicated for Hypertension", "Benzene Derivatives", "Benzophenones", "Cardiovascular Agents", "Diuretics", "Drugs causing inadvertant photosensitivity", "Heterocyclic Compounds, Fused-Ring", "Hyperglycemia-Associated Agents", "Hypotensive Agents", "Imides", "Increased Diuresis", "Isoindoles", "Ketones", "Low-Ceiling Diuretics and Potassium-Sparing Agents", "Low-Ceiling Diuretics, Excl.

Indometacin was first discovered in 1963 and it was first approved for use in the U.S. by the Food and Drug Administration in 1965, [A486] along with other acetic acid derivatives such as [diclofenac] and [sulindac] that were also developed during the 1960s.[A177871] Since then, indometacin has been extensively studied in clinical trials as one of the most potent NSAIDs in blocking prostaglandin synthesis and was among the first NSAIDs to be used in the symptomatic treatment of migraine and for headaches that eventually became known as \u201cindomethacin-responsive\u201d headache disorders.[A177871] \r\n\r\nMost commonly used in rheumatoid arthritis, ankylosing spondylitis, osteoarthritis, acute shoulder pains, and acute gouty arthritis, indometacin is currently available as oral capsules as well as other methods of administration, including rectal and intravenous formulations. Intravenous indometacin is administered to close a hemodynamically significant patent ductus arteriosus, as indicated by clinical evidence, in premature infants.[L10553] Ophthalmic indometacin has been studied and used in the symptomatic treatment of postoperative ocular inflammation and pain and/or complications after cataract surgery. Although deemed effective in reducing ocular inflammation in clinical studies, topical NSAIDs were also associated with a potential reduction in corneal sensitivity accompanied by an increased risk of superficial punctate keratitis and subjective symptoms of discomfort, including pain, burning or pricking, or a tingling sensation after instillation into the cul\u2010de\u2010sac.[A177949]",

It was developed from a targeted research programmed using molecular modelling.[A18459] Being a prodrug, enalapril is rapidly biotransformed into its active metabolite, [enalaprilat], which is responsible for the pharmacological actions of enalapril. The active metabolite of enalapril competitively inhibits the ACE to hinder the production of angiotensin II, a key component of the renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system that promotes vasoconstriction and renal reabsorption of sodium ions in the kidneys. Ultimately, enalaprilat works to reduce blood pressure and blood fluid volume.\r\n\r\nCommonly marketed under the trade name Vasotec, enalapril was first approved by the FDA in 1985 for the management of hypertension, heart failure, and asymptomatic left ventricular dysfunction.

It belongs to the statin class of medications, which are used to lower the risk of cardiovascular disease and manage abnormal lipid levels by inhibiting the endogenous production of cholesterol in the liver. More specifically, statin medications competitively inhibit the enzyme hydroxymethylglutaryl-coenzyme A (HMG-CoA) Reductase,[A181421] which catalyzes the conversion of HMG-CoA to mevalonic acid and is the third step in a sequence of metabolic reactions involved in the production of several compounds involved in lipid metabolism and transport including cholesterol, low-density lipoprotein (LDL) (sometimes referred to as \"bad cholesterol\"), and very low-density lipoprotein (VLDL). Prescribing of statin medications is considered standard practice following any cardiovascular events and for people with a moderate to high risk of development of CVD, such as those with Type 2 Diabetes. The clear evidence of the benefit of statin use coupled with very minimal side effects or long term effects has resulted in this class becoming one of the most widely prescribed medications in North America.[A181087, A181406]\r\n\r\nSimvastatin and other drugs from the statin class of medications including [atorvastatin], [pravastatin], [rosuvastatin], [fluvastatin], and [lovastatin] are considered first-line options for the treatment of dyslipidemia.[A181087, A181406] Increasing use of the statin class of drugs is largely due to the fact that cardiovascular disease (CVD), which includes heart attack, atherosclerosis, angina, peripheral artery disease, and stroke, has become a leading cause of death in high-income countries and a major cause of morbidity around the world.[A181084] Elevated cholesterol levels, and in particular, elevated low-density lipoprotein (LDL) levels, are an important risk factor for the development of CVD.[A181087,A181553] Use of statins to target and reduce LDL levels has been shown in a number of landmark studies to significantly reduce the risk of development of CVD and all-cause mortality.[A181090,A181093,A181096,A181427,A181475,A181538] Statins are considered a cost-effective treatment option for CVD due to their evidence of reducing all-cause mortality including fatal and non-fatal CVD as well as the need for surgical revascularization or angioplasty following a heart attack.[A181087, A181406] Evidence has shown that even for low-risk individuals (with <10% risk of a major vascular event occurring within 5 years) statins cause a 20%-22% relative reduction in major cardiovascular events (heart attack, stroke, coronary revascularization, and coronary death) for every 1 mmol/L reduction in LDL without any significant side effects or risks.[A181397, A181403]\r\n\r\nWhile all statin medications are considered equally effective from a clinical standpoint, [rosuvastatin] is considered the most potent;

It belongs to the sulfonylurea class of insulin secretagogues, which act by stimulating \u03b2 cells of the pancreas to release insulin. Sulfonylureas increase both basal insulin secretion and meal-stimulated insulin release. Medications in this class differ in their dose, rate of absorption, duration of action, route of elimination and binding site on their target pancreatic \u03b2 cell receptor. Sulfonylureas also increase peripheral glucose utilization, decrease hepatic gluconeogenesis and may increase the number and sensitivity of insulin receptors. Sulfonylureas are associated with weight gain, though less so than insulin. Due to their mechanism of action, sulfonylureas may cause hypoglycemia and require consistent food intake to decrease this risk. The risk of hypoglycemia is increased in elderly, debilitated and malnourished individuals. Chlorpropamide is not recommended for the treatment of NIDDM as it increases blood pressure and the risk of retinopathy (UKPDS-33). Up to 80% of the single oral dose of chlorpropramide is metabolized, likely in the liver; 80-90% of the dose is excreted in urine as unchanged drug and metabolites.

this prompted studies investigating the effect of ezetimibe on intestinal cholesterol absorption.[A15202] Ezetimibe is used as an adjunctive therapy to a healthy diet to lower cholesterol levels in primary hyperlipidemia, mixed hyperlipidemia, homozygous familial hypercholesterolemia (HoFH), and homozygous sitosterolemia (phytosterolemia).[L11347]\r\n\r\nUnlike other classes of cholesterol-reducing compounds including statins and bile acid sequestrants, ezetimibe has a distinct mechanism of action involving the sterol transporter Niemann-Pick C1-Like 1 (NPC1L1), and is unique in that it does not affect the absorption of fat-soluble nutrients such as fat-soluble vitamins, triglycerides, or bile acids.[A33313] In genetically NPC1L1-deficient mice, a 70% reduction in intestinal cholesterol absorption was seen, and these mice were insensitive to ezetimibe treatment - it was determined based on these findings that NPC1L1 plays an essential role in promoting intestinal cholesterol uptake via an ezetimibe-sensitive pathway.[A15202] By interfering with the intestinal uptake of cholesterol and phytosterols, ezetimibe reduces the delivery of intestinal cholesterol to the liver.[L11347]", "categories": ["Anticholesteremic Agents", "Azetines", "BCRP/ABCG2 Substrates", "BSEP/ABCB11 Substrates", "Cytochrome P-450 CYP2C8 Inhibitors", "Cytochrome P-450 CYP2C8 Inhibitors (strength unknown)", "Cytochrome P-450 CYP3A Inhibitors", "Cytochrome P-450 CYP3A4 Inhibitors", "Cytochrome P-450 CYP3A4 Inhibitors (strength unknown)", "Cytochrome P-450 Enzyme Inhibitors", "Decreased Cholesterol Absorption", "Dietary Cholesterol Absorption Inhibitor", "Hypolipidemic Agents", "Hypolipidemic Agents Indicated for Hyperlipidemia", "Lipid Modifying Agents", "Lipid Modifying Agents, Plain", "Lipid Regulating Agents", "OATP1B1/SLCO1B1 Substrates", "P-glycoprotein substrates", "UGT1A1 Substrates", "UGT1A3 substrates", "UGT2B7 substrates"], "ATC code": ["C10BA02", "C10BA05", "C10AX09", "C10BA06"], "indication": "Ezetimibe is indicated to reduce elevated total-C, LDL-C, Apo B, and non-HDL-C in patients with primary hyperlipidemia, alone or in combination with an HMG-CoA reductase inhibitor (statin).[L11347,L11401,L11404] It is also indicated to reduce elevated total-C, LDL-C, Apo B, and non-HDL-C in patients with mixed hyperlipidemia in combination with fenofibrate, and to reduce elevated total-C and LDL-C in patients with homozygous familial hypercholesterolemia (HoFH), in combination with atorvastatin or simvastatin.[L11347] Ezetimibe may also be used to reduce elevated sitosterol and campesterol in patients with homozygous sitosterolemia (phytosterolemia).[L11347]", "carriers": [], "targets": [{"name": "Niemann-Pick C1-like protein 1", "drugbank_id": "BE0000802", "actions": ["inhibitor"], "uniprot_id": "Q9UHC9"}, {"name": "Sterol O-acyltransferase 1", "drugbank_id": "BE0000105", "actions": ["inhibitor"], "uniprot_id": "P35610"}, {"name": "Aminopeptidase N", "drugbank_id": "BE0001078", "actions": ["other"], "uniprot_id": "P15144"}], "transporters": [{"name": "P-glycoprotein 1", "drugbank_id": "BE0001032", "actions": ["substrate"], "uniprot_id": "P08183"}, {"name": "Canalicular multispecific organic anion transporter 1", "drugbank_id": "BE0001069", "actions": ["substrate"], "uniprot_id": "Q92887"}, {"name": "Canalicular multispecific organic anion transporter 2", "drugbank_id": "BE0001061", "actions": ["substrate"], "uniprot_id": "O15438"}, {"name": "Solute carrier organic anion transporter family member 1B1", "drugbank_id": "BE0001004", "actions": ["substrate"], "uniprot_id": "Q9Y6L6"}, {"name": "ATP-binding cassette sub-family G member 2", "drugbank_id": "BE0001067", "actions": ["substrate"], "uniprot_id": "Q9UNQ0"}, {"name": "Bile salt export pump", "drugbank_id": "BE0000703", "actions": ["substrate"], "uniprot_id": "O95342"}], "enzymes": [{"name": "UDP-glucuronosyltransferase 1-1", "drugbank_id": "BE0003541", "actions": ["substrate"], "uniprot_id": "P22309"}, {"name": "UDP-glucuronosyltransferase 1-3", "drugbank_id": "BE0003677", "actions": ["substrate"], "uniprot_id": "P35503"}, {"name": "UDP-glucuronosyltransferase 2B15", "drugbank_id": "BE0004696", "actions": ["substrate"], "uniprot_id": "P54855"}, {"name": "UDP-glucuronosyltransferase 2B7", "drugbank_id": "BE0003679", "actions": ["substrate"], "uniprot_id": "P16662"}, {"name": "Cytochrome P450 3A4", "drugbank_id": "BE0002638", "actions": ["inhibitor"], "uniprot_id": "P08684"}, {"name": "Cytochrome P450 2C8", "drugbank_id": "BE0002887", "actions": ["inhibitor"], "uniprot_id": "P10632"}], "pathways": []}, {"drugbank_id": "DB00975", "name": "Dipyridamole", "synonyms": ["Dipiridamol", "Dipyridamine", "Dipyridamole", "Dipyridamolum", "Dipyudamine", "Dypyridamol"], "descriptions": "A phosphodiesterase inhibitor that blocks uptake and metabolism of adenosine by erythrocytes and vascular endothelial cells.

acid and it is considered the first of the propionics.[A39074] The formula of ibuprofen is 2-(4-isobutylphenyl) propionic acid and its initial development was in 1960 while researching for a safer alternative for aspirin.[A39075] Ibuprofen was finally patented in 1961 and this drug was first launched against rheumatoid arthritis in the UK in 1969 and USA in 1974. It was the first available over-the-counter NSAID.[A39076]\r\n\r\nOn the available products, ibuprofen is administered as a racemic mixture. Once administered, the R-enantiomer undergoes extensive interconversion to the S-enantiomer _in vivo_ by the activity of the alpha-methylacyl-CoA racemase. In particular, it is generally proposed that the S-enantiomer is capable of eliciting stronger pharmacological activity than the R-enantiomer.[A39194]", "categories": ["Acids, Carbocyclic", "Agents causing angioedema", "Agents causing hyperkalemia", "Agents that produce hypertension", "Amino Acids", "Amino Acids, Basic", "Amino Acids, Diamino", "Amino Acids, Essential", "Amino Acids, Peptides, and Proteins", "Analgesics", "Analgesics, Non-Narcotic", "Anti-Inflammatory Agents", "Anti-Inflammatory Agents, Non-Steroidal", "Antiinflammatory and Antirheumatic Products", "Antiinflammatory and Antirheumatic Products, Non-Steroids", "Antiinflammatory Preparations, Non-Steroids for Topical Use", "Antiinflammatory Products for Vaginal Administration", "Antirheumatic Agents", "Central Nervous System Agents", "COX-1 Inhibitors", "COX-2 Inhibitors", "Cyclooxygenase Inhibitors", "Cytochrome P-450 CYP2C19 Substrates", "Cytochrome P-450 CYP2C8 Substrates", "Cytochrome P-450 CYP2C9 Substrates", "Cytochrome P-450 CYP3A Substrates", "Cytochrome P-450 CYP3A4 Substrates", "Cytochrome P-450 Enzyme Inhibitors", "Cytochrome P-450 Substrates", "Drugs that are Mainly Renally Excreted", "Enzyme Inhibitors", "Experimental Unapproved Treatments for COVID-19", "Nephrotoxic agents", "Nervous System", "Non COX-2 selective NSAIDS", "OAT1/SLC22A6 inhibitors", "OAT3/SLC22A8 Inhibitors", "Other Nonsteroidal Anti-inflammatory Agents", "P-glycoprotein inhibitors", "P-glycoprotein substrates", "Peripheral Nervous System Agents", "Pharmaceutical Preparations", "Phenylpropionates", "Propionates", "Sensory System Agents", "Throat Preparations", "Topical Products for Joint and Muscular Pain", "UGT1A1 Substrates", "UGT1A3 substrates", "UGT1A9 Substrates", "UGT2B7 substrates"], "ATC code": ["G02CC01", "C01EB16", "M01AE01", "M02AA13", "R02AX02", "N02AJ08", "N02AJ19", "M01AE51"], "indication": "Ibuprofen is the most commonly used and prescribed NSAID.

doses of 10 to 40mg rosuvastatin per day were found in clinical studies to result in a 45.8% to 54.6% decreases in LDL cholesterol levels, which is about three-fold more potent than [atorvastatin]'s effects on LDL cholesterol.[A181409,A1793] However, the results of the SATURN trial[A181427] concluded that despite this difference in potency, there was no difference in their effect on the progression of coronary atherosclerosis.\r\n\r\nRosuvastatin is also a unique member of the class of statins due to its high hydrophilicity which increases hepatic uptake at the site of action, low bioavailability, and minimal metabolism via the Cytochrome P450 system.[A181523] This last point results in less risk of drug-drug interactions compared to [atorvastatin], [lovastatin], and [simvastatin], which are all extensively metabolized by Cytochrome P450 (CYP) 3A4, an enzyme involved in the metabolism of many commonly used drugs.[A181460] Drugs such as [ciclosporin], [gemfibrozil], and some antiretrovirals are more likely to interact with this statin through antagonism of OATP1B1 organic anion transporter protein 1B1-mediated hepatic uptake of rosuvastatin.[F4649, F4652]", "categories": ["Agents Causing Muscle Toxicity", "Alimentary Tract and Metabolism", "Amides", "Anticholesteremic Agents", "BCRP/ABCG2 Substrates", "Benzene Derivatives", "BSEP/ABCB11 Substrates", "Cytochrome P-450 CYP2C9 Substrates", "Cytochrome P-450 CYP3A Inhibitors", "Cytochrome P-450 CYP3A Substrates", "Cytochrome P-450 CYP3A4 Substrates", "Cytochrome P-450 CYP3A4 Substrates (strength unknown)", "Cytochrome P-450 CYP3A5 Inhibitors", "Cytochrome P-450 CYP3A5 Substrates", "Cytochrome P-450 Enzyme Inhibitors", "Cytochrome P-450 Substrates", "Drugs Used in Diabetes", "Enzyme Inhibitors", "Fluorobenzenes", "Genito Urinary System and Sex Hormones", "Gynecological Antiinfectives and Antiseptics", "Hydrocarbons, Fluorinated", "Hydrocarbons, Halogenated", "Hydroxymethylglutaryl-CoA Reductase Inhibitors", "Hypolipidemic Agents", "Hypolipidemic Agents Indicated for Hyperlipidemia", "Lipid Modifying Agents", "Lipid Modifying Agents, Plain", "Lipid Regulating Agents", "Noxae", "OAT3/SLC22A8 Inhibitors", "OAT3/SLC22A8 Substrates", "OATP1B1/SLCO1B1 Inhibitors", "OATP1B1/SLCO1B1 Substrates", "Pyrimidines", "Sulfonamides", "Sulfones", "Sulfur Compounds", "Toxic Actions"], "ATC code": ["C10BX10", "C10BX05", "C10BX07", "C10AA07", "A10BH52", "G01AE10", "C10BX13", "C10BX09", "C10BA09", "C10BX16", "C10BX17", "C10BX14", "C10BA06"], "indication": "The FDA monograph states that rosuvastatin is indicated as an adjunct to diet in the treatment of triglyceridemia, Primary Dysbetalipoproteinemia (Type III Hyperlipoproteinemia), and Homozygous Familial Hypercholesterolemia.[F4649]\r\n\r\nThe Health Canada monograph for rosuvastatin further specifies that rosuvastatin is indicated for the reduction of elevated total cholesterol (Total-C), LDL-C, ApoB, the Total-C/HDL-C ratio and triglycerides (TG) and for increasing HDL-C in hyperlipidemic and dyslipidemic conditions when response to diet and exercise alone has been inadequate.

Sulfonylureas increase both basal insulin secretion and meal-stimulated insulin release. Medications in this class differ in their dose, rate of absorption, duration of action, route of elimination and binding site on their target pancreatic \u03b2 cell receptor. Sulfonylureas also increase peripheral glucose utilization, decrease hepatic gluconeogenesis and may increase the number and sensitivity of insulin receptors. Sulfonylureas are associated with weight gain, though less so than insulin. Due to their mechanism of action, sulfonylureas may cause hypoglycemia and require consistent food intake to decrease this risk. The risk of hypoglycemia is increased in elderly, debilitated and malnourished individuals. Tolbutamide appears to be metabolized in the liver. Tolbutamide and its metabolites are excreted in urine (75-85%) and feces.", "categories": ["Alimentary Tract and Metabolism", "Blood Glucose Lowering Agents", "Cytochrome P-450 CYP2C18 Substrates",

Insulin is typically prescribed for the management of diabetes mellitus to mimic the activity of endogenously produced human insulin, a peptide hormone produced by beta cells of the pancreas that promotes glucose metabolism. Insulin is released from the pancreas following a meal to promote the uptake of glucose from the blood into internal organs and tissues such as the liver, fat cells, and skeletal muscle. Absorption of glucose into cells allows for its transformation into glycogen or fat for storage. Insulin also inhibits hepatic glucose production, enhances protein synthesis, and inhibits lipolysis and proteolysis among many other functions.\r\n\r\nInsulin is an important treatment in the management of Type 1 Diabetes (T1D) which is caused by an autoimmune reaction that destroys the beta cells of the pancreas, resulting in the body not being able to produce or synthesize the insulin needed to manage circulating blood sugar levels. As a result, people with T1D rely primarily on exogenous forms of insulin, such as insulin aspart, to lower glucose levels in the blood. Insulin is also used in the treatment of Type 2 Diabetes (T2D), another form of diabetes mellitus that is a slowly progressing metabolic disorder caused by a combination of genetic and lifestyle factors that promote chronically elevated blood sugar levels. Without treatment or improvement in non-pharmacological measures such as diet and exercise to lower blood glucose, high blood sugar eventually causes cellular resistance to endogenous insulin, and in the long term, damage to pancreatic islet cells. Insulin is typically prescribed later in the course of T2D, after trying several oral medications such as [DB00331], [DB01120], or [DB01261] have been tried, when sufficient damage has been caused to pancreatic cells that the body is no longer able to produce insulin on its own. \r\n\r\nMarketed as the brand name product NovoRapid, insulin aspart begins to exert its effects within 15 minutes of subcutaneous administration, while peak levels occur 30 to 90 minutes after administration. Due to its duration of action of around 5 hours, NovoRapid is considered \"bolus insulin\" as it provides high levels of insulin in a short period of time to mimic the release of endogenous insulin from the pancreas after meals. Bolus insulin is often combined with once daily, long-acting \"basal insulin\" such as [DB01307], [DB09564], and [DB00047] to provide low concentrations of background insulin that can keep blood sugar stable between meals or overnight. Use of basal and bolus insulin together is intended to mimic the pancreas' production of endogenous insulin, with a goal of avoiding any periods of hypoglycemia.\r\n\r\nInsulin aspart is a recombinant, biosynthetic, fast-acting insulin analogue. Compared to human insulin, it has a single amino acid substitution at position B28 where proline is replaced with aspartic acid.

By inhibiting the endogenous production of cholesterol within the liver, statins lower abnormal cholesterol and lipid levels and ultimately reduce the risk of cardiovascular disease. More specifically, statin medications competitively inhibit the enzyme hydroxymethylglutaryl-coenzyme A (HMG-CoA) Reductase,[A181421] which catalyzes the conversion of HMG-CoA to mevalonic acid. This is the third step in a sequence of metabolic reactions involved in the production of several compounds involved in lipid metabolism and transport including cholesterol, low-density lipoprotein (LDL) (sometimes referred to as \"bad cholesterol\"), and very low-density lipoprotein (VLDL). Prescribing of statin medications is considered standard practice following any cardiovascular events and for people with a moderate to high risk of development of CVD, such as those with Type 2 Diabetes. The clear evidence of the benefit of statin use coupled with very minimal side effects or long term effects has resulted in this class becoming one of the most widely prescribed medications in North America.[A181087, A181406]\r\n\r\nPitavastatin and other drugs from the statin class of medications including [atorvastatin], [pravastatin], [rosuvastatin], [fluvastatin], and [lovastatin] are considered first-line options for the treatment of dyslipidemia.[A181087, A181406] Increasing use of the statin class of drugs is largely due to the fact that cardiovascular disease (CVD), which includes heart attack, atherosclerosis, angina, peripheral artery disease, and stroke, has become a leading cause of death in high-income countries and a major cause of morbidity around the world.[A181084] Elevated cholesterol levels, and in particular, elevated low-density lipoprotein (LDL) levels, are an important risk factor for the development of CVD.[A181087,A181553] Use of statins to target and reduce LDL levels has been shown in a number of landmark studies to significantly reduce the risk of development of CVD and all-cause mortality.[A181090,A181093,A181096,A181427,A181475,A181538] Statins are considered a cost-effective treatment option for CVD due to their evidence of reducing all-cause mortality including fatal and non-fatal CVD as well as the need for surgical revascularization or angioplasty following a heart attack.[A181087, A181406] Evidence has shown that even for low-risk individuals (with <10% risk of a major vascular event occurring within 5 years) statins cause a 20%-22% relative reduction in major cardiovascular events (heart attack, stroke, coronary revascularization, and coronary death) for every 1 mmol/L reduction in LDL without any significant side effects or risks.[A181397, A181403]\r\n\r\nWhile all statin medications are considered equally effective from a clinical standpoint, [rosuvastatin] is considered the most potent; doses of 10 to 40mg [rosuvastatin] per day were found in clinical studies to result in a 45.8% to 54.6% decrease in LDL cholesterol levels.[A181409,A181535,A181538,A1793] Study data has confirmed that pitavastatin's potency in lowering LDL-C is comparable to that of other statins but also has increased efficacy in increasing HDL-C (also known as \"good cholesterol\").[A182000,A182003,A182006] Despite these differences in potency, several trials have demonstrated only minimal differences in terms of clinical outcomes between statins.[A181438, A181427]", "categories": ["Agents Causing Muscle Toxicity", "Anticholesteremic Agents", "BCRP/ABCG2 Substrates", "BSEP/ABCB11 Substrates", "Cytochrome P-450 CYP2C8 Substrates", "Cytochrome P-450 CYP2C9 Substrates", "Cytochrome P-450 Substrates", "Enzyme Inhibitors", "Heterocyclic Compounds, Fused-Ring", "Hydroxymethylglutaryl-CoA Reductase Inhibitors", "Hypolipidemic Agents", "Hypolipidemic Agents Indicated for Hyperlipidemia", "Lipid Modifying Agents", "Lipid Modifying Agents, Plain", "Lipid Regulating Agents", "OATP1B1/SLCO1B1 Inhibitors", "OATP1B1/SLCO1B1 Substrates", "OATP1B3 substrates", "P-glycoprotein substrates", "Toxic Actions", "UGT1A3 substrates", "UGT2B7 substrates"], "ATC code": ["C10AA08"], "indication": "Pitavastatin is indicated for the treatment of adult patients with primary hyperlipidemia or mixed dyslipidemia to reduce elevated total cholesterol (TC), low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C), apolipoprotein B (Apo B), triglycerides (TG), and to increase high-density lipoprotein cholesterol (HDL-C).

These results may explain the long clinical half-life of lacidipine [A31539]. \r\n\r\nIn randomised, well-controlled trials, administration of daily single-dose lacidipine ranging from 2-6 mg demonstrated comparable antihypertensive efficacy similar to that of other long-acting dihydropyridine calcium antagonists, thiazide diuretics, atenolol (a beta-blocker) and enalapril (an ACE inhibitor) [A31536].

nutrient, like [Calcium] and [Magnesium].

Hypokalemia (low potassium) or hyperkalemia (high potassium) may result, manifesting as various signs and symptoms. Some examples of potassium-related complications include life-threatening arrhythmia, neuromuscular dysfunction, diarrhea, nausea, and vomiting.[A32222,A38081,L2652]\r\n\r\nVarious pharmacological preparations have been formulated to replenish potassium. They are available in an assortment of tablet, injection, and other forms, depending on the setting and condition being treated. Potassium is often a key ingredient for intravenous fluids, given to patients in clinical settings for rehydration, nutrition, and replenishment of electrolytes. Examples of potassium formulations include potassium citrate, potassium chloride, and potassium with dextrose and sodium chloride.[L8744,L8747,L8753,L8759]", "categories": ["Agents causing hyperkalemia", "Diuretics", "Elements", "High-Ceiling Diuretics", "Low-Ceiling Diuretics, Excl.

Firstly, it used to replenish potassium that has been depleted by conditions including but not limited to malabsorption, decreased intake, or excess sodium intake.  The causes of potassium deficiency are numerous. The following indications for potassium are not comprehensive, but include the main indications for which this nutrient is used. Various products and preparations contain potassium.\r\n\r\n**Potassium chloride**\r\n\r\nPotassium chloride is one of the main preparations of potassium used in a clinical setting. The oral solution is indicated for the prevention and treatment of hypokalemia presenting with or without metabolic alkalosis, in patients who have failed conservative management with potassium-rich foods or diuretic dose titrations.[L8744] The injection form of potassium chloride is indicated to replenish potassium in patients who are not feasible candidates for oral potassium. Highly concentrated potassium is intended for the treatment of potassium deficiency in fluid restricted individuals who cannot tolerate fluid volumes normally associated with injected potassium solutions that contain lower concentrations.[L8768]\r\nFinally, the extended-release tablet preparation of potassium chloride is used to treat hypokalemia with or without metabolic alkalosis, to treat digitalis intoxication, and to manage patients with hypokalemic familial periodic paralysis. It is also used in the prevention of hypokalemia in those who are at a high risk of negative clinical outcomes if hypokalemia occurs; patients on digitalis or those with cardiac arrhythmias would be at particular risk of negative outcomes.[L8771]\r\n\r\n\r\n**Potassium chloride with dextrose and sodium chloride** \r\n\r\nThis liquid preparation is is indicated in a clinical setting as a source of water, calories and electrolytes.[L8747] Potassium acetate solution is meant as an alternative to potassium chloride, replenishing potassium and added to large volume infusion fluids for intravenous injection.[L8759]\r\n\r\n**Potassium citrate**\r\n\r\nThe potassium citrate preparation is used for the management of renal tubular acidosis (RTA) with calcium stones (nephrolithiasis); calcium oxalate stones by any cause, and uric acid nephrolithiasis (with or without calcium stones). This regimen also includes adequate water intake (leading to a urine out put of 2 L/day or more) and sodium restriction.[L8753]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n", "carriers": [], "targets": [{"name": "Sodium/potassium-transporting ATPase subunit alpha-1", "drugbank_id": "BE0000732", "actions": ["regulator"], "uniprot_id": "P05023"}], "transporters": [{"name": "Sodium/potassium-transporting ATPase subunit alpha-1", "drugbank_id": "BE0000732", "actions": ["substrate"], "uniprot_id": "P05023"}, {"name": "Solute carrier family 12 member 1", "drugbank_id": "BE0000502", "actions": ["ligand"], "uniprot_id": "Q13621"}], "enzymes": [], "pathways": []}, {"drugbank_id": "DB14533", "name": "Zinc chloride", "synonyms": [], "descriptions": "Zinc chloride is a solution of ions indicated for use in total parenteral nutrition to maintain zinc levels and prevent deficiency syndromes.[L14189]\r\n\r\nZinc chloride was granted FDA approval before 26 June 1986.[L14189]", "categories": ["Acids", "Acids, Noncarboxylic", "Agents for Treatment of Hemorrhoids and Anal Fissures for Topical Use", "Anions", "Basic Ointments and Protectants", "Blood and Blood Forming Organs", "Blood Substitutes and Perfusion Solutions", "Chlorine Compounds", "Compounds used in a research, industrial, or household setting", "Copper Absorption Inhibitor", "Cosmetics", "Dental Agents", "EENT Drugs, Miscellaneous", "Electrolyte Solutions", "Electrolytes", "Household Products", "I.V.
